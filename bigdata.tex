\begin{abstract}
Although cloud computing has made great inroads in terms of consumer adoption, we argue that the paradigm still has a long way to go to reach an economically efficient free market state.
We highlight three key problems with the current cloud computing approach. These are (1) coarse granularity of service provision, (2) inadequate support for small providers and prosumers, and (3) vendor lockin via APIs.
In this position paper, we outline interesting lines of work that may lead to some solutions to these problems. The solutions are all based on our experiences with applying economic theory to computer systems.

\section{Introduction}

Utility computing is now a well-established concept. Brief history of cloud.
Current stats. Why is cloud computing so popular? NIST definition. Talk about capex being replaced by opex.

However - not yet fully realised the power of this computing model - service provision/delivery. In this paper, we will outline three problems with cloud computing - preventing its full adoption - realising its potential - in a sustainable society.

Argue that with increasing data (big data) on cloud provision - computer systems in general - makes the problems more acute.??? Harness big data - to make a free market for all. 

Generally focus on infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) since this is where I have most experience. Same arguments will apply to other levels of cloud service provision.

\section{Paradigm Problems}

This section considers three issues with current cloud computing service provision.
These issues prevent a free market economy from operating efficiently.

\subsection{Coarse Granularity of Services}

In terms of IaaS provision, most providers offer predefined, quantized units of computing resource. For example, the lowest specification of an Amazon Web Services instance is currently \emph{t2.micro} which features a single CPU and 1 GB RAM. Although the CPU bursting concept allows some rewards for unused CPU cycles, the rewards can only be claimed in terms of subsequent processing, rather than refunds or cheaper pricing.  

Another quantized unit is the minimum time period for which instances can be commissioned. AWS customers must rent machines by the hour. Google Compute Engine customers are charged for at least 10 minutes.
Although there are some more flexible services, e.g.\ the asynchronous event-based AWS Lambda platform, such innovations are not as flexible and are not yet commonplace.

This quantization of service is inefficient, in terms of market economics. Very often, consumers will pay for more provision than they actually require. Another disadvantage is that any kind of statistical analysis, modeling or forecasting for computing requirements would be more straightforward with continuous parameters. 

Finally, the different instance types hinder fair comparison. Often, it is not possible to make direct comparisons between different IaaS providers since they are offering products that are not precisely equivalent.

\subsection{Exclusion of Small Providers}

According to a recent industrial survey, the \emph{big four} providers of compute infrastructure, (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, IBM) control over 50\% of the cloud market \footnote{\url{http://www.eweek.com/cloud/big-four-iaas-providers-now-own-half-the-market.html}}.

In terms of physical requirements, there is a great deal of overhead in building and maintaining a datacenter. Significant costs include electricity. Unexpected costs include compliance with ISO certification standards for cloud security. (Cite ``The Cost of a Cloud'' Microsoft research)

These significant barriers to entry prevent small providers from participating in the cloud service provision market. Meaningful innovation is occuring in the micro datacenter field, e.g.\ Raspberry Pi cloud and others.
However it is unlikely that such new technology will be adopted by the market in general.


A further feature of a free market is the existence of \emph{prosumers}. These are individual who buy and sell in the market. In terms of cloud computing, these are end-users who contribute compute cycles. There is a precedent for this, either in terms of research projects (BOINC) or other charitable purposes (check). Generally, volunteer computing is more closely associated with \emph{grid} rather than cloud technologies. However it may also be applicable to consumer clouds. There are clear parallels with the electricity utility market. Electricity prosumers may have solar panel installations that feed energy back into the grid. In terms of cloud computing, there is no practicable technique to harness this prosumer behaviour at present.

In the long term, the entry of small providers and prosumers to the market will require some kind of arbitration or cloud brokerage service. While brokerages exist currently, they are limited to major service providers and do not 
???
Give some examples- e.g. cloudaroo, rightscale.

\subsection{Incompatibility of Platform Utilities}

Each of the major cloud service providers presents its own custom APIs and functionality for major application-level support. Typical features include key/value storage, database and outgoing email.
There are few cloud industry standards, so all vendors offer their own, mutually incompatible, APIs.
This problematic scenario quickly leads to vendor lockin for cloud users. Any kind of software investment built on a commercial IaaS platform will have vendor-specific assumptions and dependences. 
Ideally, a vendor-neutral cloud facade would address this difficulty. Although some facade style solutions are available, none is widely adopted by customers or supported by all cloud providers.
In the same way as operating systems have the concept of POSIX compliance, we need something similar for IaaS providers. This would make it easy to migrate services dynamically from one provider to another, based on fluctuating demand, prices and other higher level non-functional concerns.

might argue that we stick with lowest common denominator - e.g. an x86 Linux server and build all services on top - e..g database etc. BUT having to administer all these services oneself is a big overhead - lose many of the benefits of utility computing in the first place (one of which is minimal setup and configuration).
